# F5 TTS â€” MLX

Implementation of [F5-TTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06885), with the [MLX](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx) framework.

F5 TTS is a non-autoregressive, zero-shot text-to-speech system using a flow-matching mel spectrogram generator with a diffusion transformer (DiT).

F5 is an evolution of [E2 TTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18009v2) and improves performance with ConvNeXT v2 blocks for the learned text alignment.

This repository is based on the original Pytorch implementation available [here](https://github.com/SWivid/F5-TTS).


## Installation

```bash
pip install f5-tts-mlx
```

Pretrained model weights are available [on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/SWivid/F5-TTS).

## Usage

```python
import mlx.core as mx

from f5-tts-mlx.cfm import CFM
from f5-tts-mlx.dit import DiT

vocab = ...
f5tts = CFM(
    transformer = DiT(
        dim = 1024,
        depth = 22,
        heads = 16,
        ff_mult = 2,
        text_dim = 512,
        conv_layers = 4,
        text_num_embeds = ...
    ),
    vocab_char_map=vocab
)
mx.eval(f5tts.parameters())
```

See `test_infer_single.py` for an example of generation.

## Appreciation
